Elevator Simulation Problem  

Edit only the function definition of Elevator.prototype.decide() in myelevator.js.  
That function is called when elevator needs to decide which floor it needs to go to.  
Try to:  
1. minimize total_people_wait_time_in_elevator  
2. minimize total_people_wait_time_out_elevator  
3. minimize total_elevator_traveled_distance  
4. maximize total_delivered_people  

    * Refer to this article http://www.businessinsider.com/the-8-fastest-elevators-in-the-world-2013-1?IR=T&op=1, speed of elevator can maximize delivered people and minimize people wait in / out elevator. So, in this case I invoked Object parameters with new value about speed and max num people
